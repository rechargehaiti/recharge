  # Fix RLS policies for transactions table

  1. Security Updates
    - Update INSERT policy to allow anonymous users (for demo mode)
    - Keep existing SELECT and UPDATE policies for authenticated users
    - Ensure demo users can create transactions

  2. Changes Made
    - Modified INSERT policy to allow anon role
    - Added fallback for demo-user functionality
    - Maintained security for authenticated operations
